I am a part of the State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Engineering at China University of Petroleum, Beijing, focusing on pioneering research in aggregation-induced emission and organic room-temperature phosphorescent materials. As a University of Oxford graduate with a distinction degree, I apply my academic foundation to explore innovative solutions in photonic materials, contributing to advances in Biomedical application.
